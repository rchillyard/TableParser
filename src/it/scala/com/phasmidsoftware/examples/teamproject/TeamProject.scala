/**
 * This class represents a TeamProject from the IMDB data file on Kaggle.
 * Although the limitation on 22 fields in a case class has partially gone away, it's still convenient to group the different attributes together into logical classes.
 *
 * Created by scalaprof on 9/12/16.
 *
 * Common questions in this assignment:
 * 1. Where is main method?
 * In most case, you don't need to run main method for assignments.
 * Unit tests are provided to test your implementation.
 * In this assignment, you will find the `object TeamProject extends App`,
 * the `App` trait can be used to quickly turn objects into executable programs.
 * You can read the official doc of Scala for more details.
 *
 * 2. How to understand the whole program in this assignment?
 * I won't suggest you to understand the whole program in this assignment,
 * there are some advanced features like `implicit` which hasn't been covered in class.
 * You should be able to understand it before midterm.
 * I will suggest you only focus on each TO BE IMPLEMENTED in the assignments.
 *
