/**
 * Class to represent the rows of a Table.
 * NOTE: do not expect an iterator on Content to be in any particular order.
 *
 * At present, the rows are implemented as a ParIterable.
 * However, we might later change the internal representation, thus xs is private.
 *
 * CONSIDER making the private val parameter an Either of ParIterable[Row] or Iterable[Row].
 * That's to say lazy/parallelized vs. eager.
 * Take care, however, as both extend GenIterable[Row].
 *
 * See [[https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/parallel-collections/overview.html]] for more information on parallel collections.
 * However, we can note a few things here:
 * <ol>
 * <li>parallel collections remain ordered unless transformed with "bulk" operations such as map, filter;</li>
 * <li>seq is always an efficient method on parallel collections;</li>
 * <li>for now, imposition of an explicit ordering is done via sorted or ordered methods.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * @param xs a ParIterable[Row].
 * @tparam Row the underlying Row type.
