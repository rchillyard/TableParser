/**
 * This iterator gets its input from a Iterator[X], which is essentially a parameterless function.
 * The first n elements of the iterator can be passed to the caller of tee.
 *
 * NOTE: this is an odd name for the class. Its purpose appears to be to drop the first n elements of an iterator and make them available via tee.
 *
 * CONSIDER passing the parameter n to the tee method instead of the constructor.
 *
 * @param n  the number of elements to detach.
 * @param xs the input iterator.
 * @tparam X the underlying type.
